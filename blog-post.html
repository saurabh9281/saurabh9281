				    <p>Building a PC on your own gives you freedom to choose the configuration that you require. However, it also comes with certain risks as most computer parts are not compatible with each other. That's why we created this guide which consists of all the essential parts needed for computer assembling so that you would be able to understand which components would enhance the performance of the machine. </p>

	    <h6 class="my-3"> What Is A Motherboard? </h6>
<p>A motherboard is a printed circuit board (PCB) that creates a backbone for communication among various components and provides different connectors for parts such as the central processing unit (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU), memory, and storage. Most computers made today, including smartphones, tablets, notebooks, and desktop computers, use motherboards to pull everything together, but the only kind you'll purchase are the ones made for desktop PCs.
Looking at the Motherboard from the top down, you'll see a collection of circuits, transistors, capacitors, slots, connectors, heat sinks, and more than all combine to route signals and power throughout the PC and allow you to plug in all the required components. </p> </br>
	    <h6 class="my-3">Here are the things that you need to consider for Motherboard </h6> </br>
	    <h6 class="my-3">CPU Slot</h6>
<p>The CPU is often called the brain of a computer because it is the hardware that carries out instructions from software by using math, input/output commands, and logic. This slot (also known as a CPU socket) is where the processor is stored on a computer's motherboard. To replace a CPU, you need to raise the socket by lifting a small lever on its side; then, you can gently pull out the CPU hardware. For replacing an old CPU with a new one, you have to align the new CPU with the socket by gently placing it in (do not push) and then flipping the socket lever to secure it.</p>
	    <h6 class="my-3">RAM Slot</h6>
<p>Random-access memory (RAM) is data storage hardware on your computer's motherboard. Despite the name, RAM does not actually "remember" anything when a computer is turned off. Programs must be saved on the hard drive or another storage device. In practical terms, RAM determines the number of programs that can run at a time and the length of each one. Besides, computers cannot run without RAM installed and come with multiple strips located in RAM slots on the motherboard that are easily removable and replaceable. Upgrading RAM will improve the speed of your computer.</p>
	    <h6 class="my-3">PCI Slot</h6>
<p>The Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) is a slot for expansion devices. Most desktop computers come with several PCI expansion slots. These slots are used for a variety of devices like modems, network cards, television tuners, radio tuners, video cards, sound cards, and more. Most computers today have several of these cards already built in. Those PCs that do not have these cards, the expansion devices provide additional functionality, making it possible for essential functions such as wireless Internet connectivity.</p>
	    <h6 class="my-3">PCI Express Slot</h6>
<p>The PCI Express slot, like the PCI slot, is used for expansion cards. PCI Express allows for higher transfer speeds than PCI and is therefore preferred for graphics cards. The PCI Express has replaced Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) in most computers as the primary slot for graphics cards. Many newer programs, such as Adobe's popular photo and video editors, rely more on an advanced graphics card to process data. Upgrading your graphics card can improve performance markedly.</p>

<b> There are the most important sockets and chipsets today: </b>

<p>
It’s not so important to understand everything that goes into making a chipset, but it is essential to understand that you need to select a motherboard with the right chipset—and the right socket—for the CPU that you plan to purchase. Moreover, you should also know that different chipsets provide support for different combinations of components such as RAM, GPUs, and others. </p>
